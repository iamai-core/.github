## Project Overview

iamai-core is an open-source project dedicated to developing cutting-edge AI technology that runs entirely on personal devices, without relying on cloud services. Unlike traditional AI models that require cloud infrastructure for training and processing, iamai-core provides users with complete control over their data and AI models. This ensures enhanced privacy and accountability, addressing growing concerns about data security and the ethical implications of cloud-based AI systems.

## Company Overview

iamai-core specializes in building AI companions that learn and grow continuously based on user interactions, offering a truly personalized experience. The technology combines high-performance core systems written in C/C++, optional Python for AI agents, game engine plugins and a modern frontend built using JavaScript and React. This project allows for seamless integration of text, audio, and visual interfaces to interact with AI assistants. Developers can extend functionality through our plugin system, making it easy to add new features or integrate with existing projects.

## Key Highlights:
- Open-Source AI: iamai-core focuses on providing a transparent, open-source framework for AI development.
- Local, Private Data Processing: All data is processed locally on personal devices, ensuring that user data remains private and secure.
- Real-Time Data Processing and Neural Networks: The project emphasizes real-time data processing and AI model training using consumer-grade hardware.
- Cross-Platform Architecture: A robust system capable of running on various devices and operating systems.
