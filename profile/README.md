## Project Overview

iamai-core is an open-source project dedicated to developing cutting-edge AI technology that runs entirely on personal devices, without relying on cloud services. Unlike traditional AI models that require cloud infrastructure for training and processing, iamai-core provides users with complete control over their data and AI models. This ensures enhanced privacy and accountability, addressing growing concerns about data security and the ethical implications of cloud-based AI systems.

iamai-core specializes in building AI companions that learn and grow continuously based on user interactions, offering a truly personalized experience. The technology combines high-performance core systems written in C/C++, optional Python for AI agents, game engine plugins and a modern frontend built using JavaScript and React. This project allows for seamless integration of text, audio, and visual interfaces to interact with AI assistants.

## Key Highlights:
- Open-Source AI: iamai-core focuses on providing a transparent, open-source framework for AI development.
- Local, Private Data Processing: All data is processed locally on personal devices, ensuring that user data remains private and secure.
- Real-Time Data Processing: The project emphasizes real-time data processing and AI model training using consumer-grade hardware.
- Cross-Platform Architecture: A robust system capable of running on various devices and operating systems.
- Dual Design: Powerful tools for developers while maintaining simple apps for everyone else.
